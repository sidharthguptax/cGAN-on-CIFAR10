# cGAN on CIFAR-10: Class-Conditional Image Generation

A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset 
to generate synthetic images conditioned on class labels. This project demonstrates 
the potential of cGANs in addressing class imbalance through synthetic data generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- Pillow
- pytorch-fid
- numpy
- jupyterlab

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidharthguptax/cGAN-on-CIFAR10.git
cd cGAN-on-CIFAR10
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib Pillow pytorch-fid numpy jupyterlab
```

## How to Run

1. Launch JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

2. Open `Project_Implementation_II.ipynb`

3. Run all cells sequentially (imports → FID Score)
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset will be downloaded automatically
   - Training will begin and checkpoints will be saved every 10 epochs

4. Google Colab is recommended for faster training. 
   On CPU, each epoch takes approximately 12-15 minutes.
   On GPU (Google Colab), each epoch takes approximately a minute or less.

5. After training, the notebook will automatically:
   - Generate and visualize one image per class
   - Compute the FID score
   - Save loss curves

## Results
The target FID score was < 50 but due to computational limitations and time constraints, more model evolution was not possible.
The model was trained for 60 epochs, saving a checkpoint after every 10 epochs.
The best weights within these epochs were at epoch 40 and hence the final results are given on these weights.
The achieved FID score was ~103.77
